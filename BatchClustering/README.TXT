Short Text Stream Clustering via Frequent Word Pairs and Reassignment of Outliers to Clusters

ABSTRACT
Short text stream clustering is an important but challenging task since massive amounts of text are generated from different social media. Given streams of texts, the proposed method clusters the streams of texts based on the frequently occurring word pairs (not necessarily consecutive) in texts. It detects outliers in the clusters and reassigns the outliers to appropriate clusters using the semantic similarity between the outliers and the clusters based on the dynamically computed similarity thresholds. Thus the proposed method efficiently deals with the concept drift problem. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art short text stream clustering algorithms by a statistically significant margin on several short text datasets.
