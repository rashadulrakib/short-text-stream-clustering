Motivation:
Text Clustering plays a significant role to find
duplicate or similar texts.
In this work, we are proposing a system
that reduces the search space for finding duplicate
stackoverflow questions using a
state-of-the-art short text Stream Clustering algorithm.
The reason for using text Stream Clustering algorithm
is that the questions
 are continuously being posted in stackoverflow and
 its quite an expensive job to cluster
  such a huge collection of questions using
  a static text clustering algorithm.
 To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one who are
 proposing this kind of system to reduce the search space
 for finding duplicate questions in stackoverflow.

 To show the effectiveness of our system, we define
 the following research questions:

 1. Given a set of questions,
 we try to find out for how may of them,
 we can find the duplicate questions.

2. What is the median of
search-ranks for finding duplicate questions.

3. Under which similarity settings (e.g., tag, title, body, combination of tag, title and body similarities)
our system performs better in terms of finding duplicate questions.

We compare our system with
lucene with in the extent of answering the
above research questions.
Our experimental results demonstrate that our system
outperforms lucene in most of experimental scenarios
while answering the above research questions.
